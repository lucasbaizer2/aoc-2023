# aoc-2023

This is a Go program that contains my solutions for the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Building

To build the `aoc-2023` executable:
```bash
make build
```

### Prerequisites

GNU make and Go and required.

## Usage

```bash
./aoc-2023 --day 3 --part 2 --input real
```
This will execute the challenge for day 3, part 2 using the real input.
To provide the input, create the file `inputs/dayN/real.txt` and paste the input.

You can run `./aoc-2023 --help` for the full list of options.
